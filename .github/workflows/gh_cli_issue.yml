# Adding comments to explain the installation check of GH CLI and its subsequent commands
# if ! command checks if gh command exists in the path if no then it returns false or error which then is reverted by the ! logical not operator
# then error or ouput which is generated from this is redirected to &> /dev/null where it will dispose them off (/dev/null) 
# &> is responsible for redirection of errors and outputs
# then we check the GPG keys with specific fingerpring from the ubuntu server to authenticate the integrity of the software packages being installed
# apt-add-repository is then added to the ubuntu packages so that it can installed directly using apt
