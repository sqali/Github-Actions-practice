# That is why another if condition is imposed within the steps to check if an issue with a similar name already exists in the repo

# If it does then the issue will not be created and skipped

# Adding comments to explain the installation check of GH CLI and its subsequent commands
# if ! command checks if gh command exists in the path if no then it returns false or error which then is reverted by the ! logical not operator
# Then error or output that is generated from this is redirected to &> /dev/null where it will dispose of them (/dev/null) 
# &> is responsible for the redirection of errors and outputs
# Then we check the GPG keys with specific fingerprints from the Ubuntu server to authenticate the integrity of the software packages being installed
# apt-add-repository is then added to the Ubuntu packages so that it can installed directly using apt
